# Agentic Workflow & Deployment

## The "Mac Hive" Process
1. **Design (Stitch):** UI is initially conceptualized and generated in Google Stitch.
2. **Code (Agentic):** Antigravity (the agent) implements the design using Next.js and Tailwind.
3. **Deploy:** Instant deployment to Vercel.

## Workflow Rules
- **Prototyping:** When creating new pages, refer to the [wire-frame.md](file:///Users/mohammedharis/Developer/mac-hive/projects/mac-hive/docs/wire-frame.md) and [PRD.md](file:///Users/mohammedharis/Developer/mac-hive/projects/mac-hive/docs/PRD.md).
- **SEO:** Always include proper meta tags and semantic HTML for every page to ensure high lighthouse scores.
- **Performance:** Optimize images using `next/image` and ensure no blocking scripts. Target 95+ PageSpeed score.
- **Responsiveness:** All components must be tested for mobile-first responsiveness.
